It's been a long time waiting forever
Even tho it is so dark
I'll never surrender

When I think of the fame
And I think of the gain
Imma play the same game that I've always played
It's a roll of the dice and I think twice
I shouldn't have let you in
Living in a nightmare and I can't seem to get away
Living in a nightmare that you create to kill the pain
Still living in a nightmare you made
Still living in a nightmare you made
I saw it coming, always knew it would
You'll have to hold on til you close your eyes for good
When I think of the fame
And I think of the gain
Imma play the same game that I've always played
It's a roll of the dice and when I think twice
I shouldn't have let you in
Living in a nightmare and I can't seem to get away
Living in a nightmare that you create to kill the pain
Still living in the nightmare you made
Still living in the nightmare you made

(Never saw it coming)
Never saw it coming
(Never saw it coming)
Never saw it coming
Living in a nightmare and I can't seem to get away
Living in a nightmare that you create to kill the pain
Living in a nightmare and I can't seem to get away
Living in a nightmare that you create to kill the pain (Living in a nightmare)
When I think of the fame
And I think of the gain
Imma play the same game that I've always played (Living in a nightmare)
It's a roll of the dice and when I think twice
I shouldn't have let you in (Living in a nightmare)
When I think of the fame
And I think of the gain
Imma play the same game that I've always played (Living in a nightmare)
It's a roll of the dice and when I think twice
I shouldn't have let you in (Living in a nightmare)
